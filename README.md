# Super Awesome Theme (Boilerplate)

This is the boilerplate for Taco Themes.

## Getting Started

To create your own theme, download this repository. For the next steps, let's assume your theme should be called `Taco World`.

1. Rename the directory to `taco-world`.
2. Replace all occurrences of `super-awesome-theme` with `taco-world`.
3. Replace all occurrences of `SUPER_AWESOME_THEME` with `TACO_WORLD`.
4. Replace all occurrences of `super_awesome_theme` with `taco_world`.
5. Replace all occurrences of `Super_Awesome_Theme` with `Taco_World`.
6. Replace all occurrences of `Super Awesome Theme` with `Taco World`.

Then, update the stylesheet header in `style.css` and the version number in `functions.php` with your own information. Then you're good to go!
